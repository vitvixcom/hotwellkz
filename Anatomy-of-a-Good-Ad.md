# Anatomy of a Good Google Ads RSA · 2026


Everything that goes into a high-converting Responsive Search Ad for a service business.
Sourced from 10 PPC blogs + Google's official editorial guidelines.


**Use this as the spec Claude reads before generating ad copy, and as the rubric the human
reviews against before pushing live.**

## 1. RSA fundamentals


An RSA is one ad slot that contains an **asset pool**:


| Asset | Max length | Min required | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Headline | **30 chars** | 3 | **15 (fill all slots)** | Slot 1 visible 100%, slot 2 ~90%, slot 3 only sometimes |
| Description | **90 chars** | 2 | **4 (fill all slots)** | Description 1 visible 100%, others rotate |
| Final URL | 1024 chars | 1 | 1 per SKAG | Must match the landing page exactly (no redirects) |
| Display URL path1 | **15 chars** | 0 | 1 | Optional but improves click-through |
| Display URL path2 | **15 chars** | 0 | 1 | Optional |


> **Why fill all 15 headlines + 4 descriptions:** Google's ML tests up to **43,680 combinations**
> (15 × 14 × 4) per query. Skipping headlines starves the algorithm. Advertisers who fill all 15
> see **6% higher CTR** than those who only fill 5-8.


---


## 2. The 6 headline patterns that convert


Every RSA's 15 headlines should cover **at least 5 of these 6 angles**. Variety beats repetition —
if 15 headlines all say "Emergency Plumber Toronto" with slight wording changes, Google's ML
has nothing to test.


### 2.1 Keyword + location (for pinning slot 1)


Always include 3 keyword variants pinned to slot 1. The exact-match search query in the
headline boosts Quality Score and conversion intent matches.


| Pattern | Example for `emergency plumber toronto` |
|---|---|
| `[Keyword] [city]` | `Emergency Plumber Toronto` |
| `[City] [keyword]` | `Toronto Emergency Plumber` |
| `[Modifier] [keyword]` | `24/7 Emergency Plumber` |


### 2.2 Offer / USP (unpinned · let Google rotate)


The differentiator that makes your service business stand out. Always include 3 offer variants
but **do NOT pin them.** Modern best practice (2024+): pin slot 1 only. Smart Bidding finds the
best offer headline on its own — pinning slot 2 cuts effective combinations from ~43,000 to ~3,000
and hurts performance by 10-15%.


| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| `[Price modifier] [offer]` | `No Callout Fee Today` |
| `[Time guarantee]` | `On Site Within 60 Min` |
| `[Trust signal]` | `Licensed · Same Day` |


### 2.3 Trust / social proof (unpinned)


Numbers convert better than vague claims. Use ratings, review counts, years in business.


| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| `[Star rating] · [review count]` | `4.9★ from 482 Reviews` |
| `[Years] Years [Service]` | `15 Years Plumbing GTA` |
| `Licensed · Insured` | `Licensed & Insured` |


### 2.4 Urgency / scarcity (unpinned)


Service businesses naturally have urgency (especially emergency services). Don't fabricate it.


| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| `[Time] Response` | `60-Minute Response` |
| `[Day] Service` | `Same-Day Service` |
| `Open 24/7` | `Call Now · 24/7` |


### 2.5 Specific guarantees (unpinned)


Concrete promises that reduce anxiety. The more specific, the better.


| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| `[Years]-Year [Guarantee]` | `10-Year Warranty` |
| `[Money-back terms]` | `Upfront Pricing` |
| `No [bad thing]` | `No Hidden Fees` |


### 2.6 Call-to-action (unpinned)


What you want the user to do next. Pair with the lead-form on the landing page.


| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| `Call Now · [number]` | `Call Now · 24/7` |
| `Get a [thing] in [time]` | `Free Quote in 2 Min` |
| `Book Online` | `Book Online Today` |


---


## 3. Description patterns


Each RSA needs 4 descriptions. Each ≤ 90 chars. Aim for **61-70 chars** — long enough to be
persuasive, short enough to render fully on all screen sizes.


### Description structure (each one):


**[Service promise] · [Trust signal] · [CTA]**


Examples:


```
On site within 60 minutes. Licensed Toronto plumbers, upfront pricing, 4.9★.
```


```
Call now or book online. 24/7 emergency response across the GTA. 10-yr warranty.
```


```
No callout fee. No hidden charges. Same-day service. Family-owned and trusted.
```


```
Get a free quote in 2 minutes. Licensed Toronto plumbers, same-day emergency service.
```


### Description angles to cover (use all 4):


1. **Service + speed**: what you do + how fast
2. **Trust + price**: licensing/insurance + pricing transparency
3. **Differentiator**: what makes you not interchangeable
4. **Direct CTA**: explicit ask (call, book, quote)


---


## 4. The pinning decision tree


Pinning **restricts** Google's ML from rotating that headline into other positions. Use it
when consistency matters more than testing flexibility.


| Asset | Pin to? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 3 keyword headlines | **Slot 1** | Guarantees keyword always in position 1 = Quality Score boost |
| 12 unpinned headlines (offer + trust + urgency + CTA + brand) | **No pin** | Let Google's ML find the best combinations for positions 2-15 |
| 4 descriptions | **No pin** | Google rotates the best fit per query — don't restrict |


> **The 2024+ research consensus**: Single-pin (slot 1 only) outperforms dual-pin by 10-15% in
> conversion volume at the same CPA. Pinning slot 2 made sense in 2018-2021 when Google's
> rotation logic was dumb, but Smart Bidding has gotten much better at finding the right offer
> headline on its own. Pin slot 1 for SKAG discipline + Quality Score; let Google rotate the rest.


---


## 5. Character + format rules (Google's editorial policy)


Violate these and your ads get rejected within minutes — Google's editorial review is automated.


### Hard rules (will trigger rejection)


| Rule | Why | Wrong | Right |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Max 1 exclamation mark per ad** | Punctuation abuse | `Best Plumber!!!` | `Best Plumber` |
| **No exclamation marks in headlines** | Reserved for descriptions only | `Call Now!` | `Call Now` |
| **No ALL CAPS words** (>1 caps word back-to-back) | "Shouty" formatting | `FREE QUOTE TODAY` | `Free Quote Today` |
| **No gimmicky spacing** | Deceptive formatting | `F R E E` or `F.R.E.E.` or `S*A*L*E` | `Free Service` |
| **No repeated punctuation** | Spammy | `Save... Today` | `Save Today` |
| **No emoji or symbols for emphasis** | Non-standard chars | `★★★ Plumber ★★★` | `4.9★ Rated` (1 star is OK) |
| **No unsubstantiated superlatives** | Need third-party proof | `#1 Plumber Toronto` | `4.9★ Rated Plumber Toronto` |
| **No misleading claims** | Truth in advertising | `Guaranteed Cheapest` | `Upfront Fixed Pricing` |
| **No phone numbers in headlines** | Use call extensions instead | `Call 416-555-1234` | `Call Now · 24/7` |


### Soft rules (won't reject but hurt CTR / Ad Strength)


- Using "Click here" — meaningless, ML scores it low
- Using "We" / "Our" / "Us" — talk about THEM, not you
- Generic claims with no number ("Many customers love us") — be specific or skip
- Padding to fill character limits — short focused beats long padded


---


## 6. Things to NEVER do (auto-rejection list)


These will get individual ads disapproved within minutes of publishing:


1. **All caps words**: `FREE`, `BEST`, `URGENT`
2. **Multiple exclamation marks**: `Sale!!`, `Now!!!`
3. **Symbols for attention**: `→`, `★★★`, `🔥`, `>>>`
4. **Gimmicky spacing**: `F R E E`, `F-R-E-E`
5. **Unverified claims**: `#1`, `Best`, `Cheapest`, `Guaranteed` without proof
6. **Trademark abuse**: competitor brand names in headlines (unless authorized)
7. **Phone numbers in display copy**: use call extensions
8. **Sensational language**: "shocking", "amazing", "miracle"
9. **Promises of legality**: "Legal Solution", "Lawyer Approved"
10. **Health claims**: "Cures", "Heals", "Eliminates" — only in specific verticals


---


## 7. Quality Score factors (in priority order)


Google's QS is calculated from 3 factors. Your RSA can only influence 2 of them directly.


### 7.1 Expected CTR (ad-level)
- **You influence this**: better headlines = higher CTR
- **What to do**: vary the 6 patterns in §2 across your 15 headlines
- **Bad signal**: 15 nearly-identical headlines


### 7.2 Ad Relevance (ad-level)
- **You influence this**: keyword in headlines, description that matches search intent
- **What to do**: ALWAYS include the SKAG keyword in 3 headlines pinned to slot 1
- **Bad signal**: ad copy that doesn't mention the keyword at all


### 7.3 Landing Page Experience (LP-level)
- **You don't influence this with ad copy** — it's a property of the LP
- **What to do**: make sure the LP H1 matches your ad headline word-for-word


> **The 2026 finding**: Ad Strength "Excellent" correlates with 15% more clicks and conversions
> vs "Poor". But Ad Strength is NOT the same as Quality Score — high Ad Strength on a SKAG with
> poor LP match still has bad QS. Fix LP match first.

## 8. Self-review checklist (run before publishing)


Before any RSA goes to the approval queue, verify each item:


### Per-headline checks (run on all 15)
- [ ] ≤ 30 characters
- [ ] No ALL CAPS words
- [ ] No exclamation marks
- [ ] No emoji / no symbols beyond `·` and `&`
- [ ] No phone numbers
- [ ] No unsubstantiated superlatives (`#1`, `best`, `top`)
- [ ] No competitor brand names


### Per-description checks (run on all 4)
- [ ] ≤ 90 characters
- [ ] Max 1 exclamation mark per description, max 1 across all 4 descriptions in the ad
- [ ] No ALL CAPS, no symbols, no gimmicks
- [ ] Ends with a CTA or a benefit (not mid-thought)


### Ad-level checks
- [ ] 3 keyword headlines pinned to slot 1 (only slot to pin)
- [ ] 12 unpinned headlines covering ≥ 5 of the 6 patterns in §2 (offer, trust, urgency, CTA, brand)
- [ ] All 4 descriptions in distinct angles
- [ ] Final URL is exact LP path (no `?` query params unless tracking)
- [ ] path1 + path2 ≤ 15 chars each
- [ ] No two headlines/descriptions are nearly identical


### Ad group-level checks (across the 3 RSAs)
- [ ] Each RSA tests a different angle (speed / trust / value, for example)
- [ ] All 3 RSAs share the same final URL (same LP) — that's the SKAG model
- [ ] Total assets across 3 RSAs: 45 headlines, 12 descriptions — but the asset POOL can be smaller if Google flags duplicates
